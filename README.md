## Project Overview
This project is for COMP3423 Human Computer Interaction,mainly focuses on improving the official "My Library" app by Hong Kong Public Libraries (HKPL). The original app had key design issues violating core HCI principles, leading to confusion and inefficiency. We analyzed 5 critical flaws, proposed targeted solutions, built a Figma prototype, and validated it through user testing.

## Core Improvements
### Simplified Navigation: 
Replaced inconsistent bottom icons and overcrowded side menu with a persistent 4-tab navigation (Home, Search, My Account, More).
### Smarter Search: 
Added dynamic "chip" filters for instant use and real-time results, replacing tedious multi-step filtering.
### Clearer Information Hierarchy: 
Redesigned search results and book details pages to highlight key content (title, author, book cover) and de-emphasize minor metadata.
### Centralized Settings: 
Grouped fragmented options (font size, language, theme) into one page for seamless adjustments.
## Prototype & Testing
### Prototype: Built with Figma (link to be added) – features widget-style home screen, integrated search, and user-friendly book reservation flow.
User Testing: Conducted via Maze with 5 mobile-savvy participants. Results: 100% task success rate, fewer misclicks, and faster book reservations.
